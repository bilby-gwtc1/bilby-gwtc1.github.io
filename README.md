## Welcome to the public data release for Bilby's reanalysis of GWTC-1

This page contains the summarypages generated with publically available data
using the [pesummary](https://lscsoft.docs.ligo.org/pesummary/) python package.
This webpage acts as an accompaniment to the
[reanalysis of the first LIGO-Virgo gravitational-wave transient catalogue paper with Bilby](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.00714.pdf).
All command lines that were used to generate the webpages can be found on the
webpages themselves under 'About' tab. Details of the environment which was
used to generate the webpages can be seen under the 'Version' tab. Samples
can be downloaded from the 'Downloads' tab.
