## Welcome to the public webpages for Bilby's reanalysis of GWTC-1

As an accompaniment to the
[reanalysis of the first LIGO-Virgo gravitational-wave transient catalogue paper with Bilby](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.00714),
this page contains the associated data release of posterior samples generated
using the [bilby](https://lscsoft.docs.ligo.org/bilby/) python package presented
in the above publication. We also release versions of the
[original LVC LALInference samples](https://dcc.ligo.org/LIGO-P1800370/public)
reweighted by the bilby default priors for reproducibility.

These webpages were made using the
[pesummary](https://lscsoft.docs.ligo.org/pesummary/) python package. All command
lines that were used to generate the webpages can be found on the
webpages themselves under 'About' tab. Details of the environment which was
used to generate the webpages can be seen under the 'Version' tab. Samples
can be downloaded from the 'Downloads' tab.

### Data Release

The posterior samples generated using the bilby python package can be downloaded
though the LIGO-Virgo Document Control Center (DCC):
